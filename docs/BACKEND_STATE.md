# VibeKit Backend State & Developer Guide

## Overview
This backend is a **production-grade, contract-driven, AI agent-friendly boilerplate** for modern SaaS and app development. It is designed for rapid, safe, and scalable extension, and is ready for seamless frontend integration.

## Key Patterns & Practices
- **API Contract-Driven:** Endpoints, types, and validation match the frontend contract map and component summaries.
- **TypeScript & Zod:** All request/response payloads are strictly typed and validated.
- **Service Layer:** Each domain has a dedicated service class for business logic, decoupled from route handlers.
- **Drizzle ORM:** All entities have models and migration stubs, ready for extension.
- **Auth Guards:** Use `requireAuth` for protected endpoints.
- **Testing:** Jest unit test stubs for all services; ready for further coverage.
- **Environment Validation:** All env vars validated in `config/env.ts` and documented in `.env.example`/`README.md`.
- **Error Handling:** Standardized error response schema for all APIs.
- **Rate Limiting:** In-memory and Redis-based options, production-ready.

---

## AI Agent-Led Dev Boilerplate Readiness
- **Fully modular and convention-driven:** All new features can be scaffolded, typed, and tested by an AI agent or developer with minimal context.
- **No hidden dependencies:** All contracts, models, and services are explicit and discoverable.
- **Extensible:** Adding new endpoints, models, or services follows a clear, repeatable pattern.
- **Safe for automation:** All critical flows (auth, validation, error handling) are standardized and easy to extend.

---

## Documentation & Onboarding
- **README.md:** Comprehensive, covers setup, environment, API error schema, rate limiting, logging, and more.
- **backend_integration_plan.md:** All backend integration steps tracked and checked off.
- **.env.example:** All required and optional environment variables listed.
- **Inline code comments:** Key files and patterns are commented for clarity.

---

## What's Ready
- All endpoints scaffolded and typed
- Drizzle models and migrations stubbed
- Zod validation schemas present
- Service layer stubs created
- Jest unit test stubs present
- Auth/session guard utility present
- Environment validation and docs updated
- Integration plan complete

## What's Next (Post-Frontend Integration)
- Implement business logic in service stubs as needed
- Adjust types/endpoints if frontend contract changes
- Add E2E tests for real user flows
- Extend documentation as new features are added

---

## Handoff Checklist for Frontend Developers
- [ ] Review the API contract in `types/app/` and `app/api/` route stubs
- [ ] Integrate frontend data flows with the scaffolded endpoints
- [ ] If new fields or endpoints are needed, update the contract and notify backend devs
- [ ] Use the standardized error response schema for error handling in the frontend
- [ ] Reference `.env.example` and `README.md` for required environment variables
- [ ] For protected routes, ensure frontend handles 401/403 responses from `requireAuth`

---

## Onboarding Checklist for New Backend Developers
- [ ] Read `README.md` for setup, environment, and project conventions
- [ ] Review `backend_integration_plan.md` for completed steps and project scope
- [ ] Explore `app/api/` for all endpoint stubs and Zod validation
- [ ] Review `types/app/` for all request/response interfaces
- [ ] Review `lib/db/schema/` for Drizzle ORM models and plan migrations as needed
- [ ] Implement business logic in `modules/` service stubs as features are prioritized
- [ ] Add/extend Jest tests in `tests/` for new logic
- [ ] Use `requireAuth` for any new protected endpoints
- [ ] Update documentation as new features or changes are made

---

**For any new feature or integration, follow the established patterns for contracts, validation, and testing.**

**This backend is ready for AI agent-led or developer-driven extension and production use.**
